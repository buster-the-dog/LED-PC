# LED-PC

Run on a raspberry pi with command "python scores.py 19"
19 is the team ID for St. Louis Blues, this can be interchanged with any other team if needed.
When it detects a score, sends a pulsing signal to one of the GPIO ports

If they're playing the Blackhawks, in stead of the normal goal horn, it plays the horn, along with a section from "I Hate Chicago"
